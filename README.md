# Visualizing Shostakovich: How the DSCH motif appears throughout his Tenth Symphony

Written as part of my final project for the wonderful class __FRSEMR 63C: The Symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich__ taught by [Professor Shreffler](https://music.fas.harvard.edu/shreffler.html). 

This project aims to explore the use of Dimitri Shostakovich's autobiographical [DSCH motif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSCH_motif) in his Tenth Symphony, primarily in the third movement. 
To do so, I use audio tools to retrieve appearances of this motif from sound recordings, and data analysis tools to visualize and examine its use through the symphony.
Using these visualizations, I also attempt to provide an interpretation of the third and fourth movements as a whole, which can be read about further in the final paper.

# Libraries Used
- [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) for audio processing
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for general data manipulation, and some data analysis
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for all the visualizations
